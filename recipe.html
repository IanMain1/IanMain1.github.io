    <p>The poblano chili is used to make chili relleno. The poblano is thought to have originated in Puebla. Puebla is a State in Mexico located southeast of Mexico City. One story suggests it was the nuns in Puebla first produced the dish we now call chili relleno. They called it 'Chile en Nogada' and possibly served it to interesting General in Mexican history after he was involved in a Mexican military victory in Puebla on the 5th of May. The Puebla nuns made their chili relleno in a walnut sauce and then sprinkled it with parsley and pomegranate seeds</p>
